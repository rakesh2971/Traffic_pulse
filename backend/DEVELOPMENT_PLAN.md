# 10-Day Development Plan: AI-Based Traffic Management System (Backend + Frontend)

## Overview
This project aims to develop a smart, AI-based traffic management system that monitors real-time traffic conditions and dynamically adjusts traffic light timings to optimize flow and reduce congestion. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB; the frontend will use React.

## Day-by-Day Plan

### Backend & Database Tasks
- **Day 1:** Finalize project architecture, design REST API endpoints, plan MongoDB schema
- **Day 2:** Set up Node.js + Express, set up MongoDB, create basic endpoints
- **Day 3:** Implement POST/GET routes for traffic data, insert dummy data, connect to MongoDB
- **Day 4:** Implement signal timing logic (basic rules), add emergency override API
- **Day 5:** Simulate traffic changes, implement emergency vehicle logic
- **Day 6:** Integrate basic AI logic (Flask model if time allows), setup endpoints for AI
- **Day 7:** Add logging (save all traffic changes), handle backend errors and status codes
- **Day 8:** Deploy backend on Render/Cyclic, ensure CORS, secure API keys
- **Day 9:** Write API documentation, final bug fixing and edge-case testing
- **Day 10:** Prepare report, README, slides, write future scope & contribution guidelines

### Frontend Tasks
- **Day 1:** Design UI wireframes, choose color scheme & layout
- **Day 2:** Build React app base, create basic component structure
- **Day 3:** Design Traffic Dashboard, create dummy visuals
- **Day 4:** Integrate API to fetch live signal data, add color-coded signals
- **Day 5:** Add button for emergency override, show real-time status updates
- **Day 6:** Refactor UI for responsiveness, add loading indicators
- **Day 7:** Create charts to display traffic trends, signal changes
- **Day 8:** Deploy frontend on Netlify/Vercel, add deployment link
- **Day 9:** Finalize UI polish: colors, typography, responsiveness
- **Day 10:** Add animations or final tweaks, ensure UI matches flow

### Joint Goals
- **Day 1:** Finalize tech stack, GitHub repo + task board
- **Day 2:** Decide frontend-backend data structure
- **Day 3:** Connect frontend to backend using Axios/Fetch
- **Day 4:** Test flow: add traffic → signal timing adjusts
- **Day 5:** Demo simulation: update signals based on load
- **Day 6:** Connect AI result to frontend (simulate behavior)
- **Day 7:** Showcase real-time data visualization
- **Day 8:** Test full integration (deployed URLs)
- **Day 9:** Record demo video walkthrough
- **Day 10:** Submit everything & practice pitch/demo
